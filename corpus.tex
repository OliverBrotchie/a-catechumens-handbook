			The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will exult exceedingly

			Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him
			glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age,

			Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For
			your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand upon
			me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my
			bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy
			burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of
			my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning
			all day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing
			in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the
			groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was
			not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the
			light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and
			stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life
			used force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated
			trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is
			dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in
			whose mouth there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will
			answer me, O Lord my God. For I  said: Let my foes never exult over me.
			When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain
			is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin.
			But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly
			have been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have
			slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not
			go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation.

			But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth,

			Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you.

			Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
			Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He forgives all your
			iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your life from corruption
			and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire with
			good things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle's. The Lord performs
			deeds of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his
			ways to Moses, his wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate
			and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful,
			nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our
			iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height of
			heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that
			fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from
			us. As a father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who
			fear him. For he knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust.
			As for man, his days are but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the
			field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will be no more and will know its
			place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon those
			who fear him; and his justice upon their children's children, upon those who
			keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord
			has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the
			Lord, all you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and
			listen to the voice of his words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his
			Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his works. In every place
			of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!

			Let us sing to the Lord, for he is greatly glorified; horse and rider he has
			cast into the sea. Helper and protector he has become for my salvation; he
			is my God and I will glorify him; my father's God and I will exalt him.
			\item Then the leaders of Edom and the rulers of the Moabites hastened;
			trembling took hold of them; all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.
			Let fear and trembling fall upon them; by the greatness of your arm let
			them be turned to stone.
			\abr{Glory.}
			\item Till your people pass over, O Lord; till your people, whom you have
			purchased, pass over. The sanctuary which you have made, Lord; which your
			hands have prepared.
			\abr{Both now.}
			\item The Lord reigns over the ages and for ever and ever; for Pharaoh's
			horse went with the chariots and horsemen into the sea. But the children
			of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.

			My heart is established in the Lord, my spirit is exalted in my God; my
			mouth derides my enemies, I rejoice in your salvation. There is none holy
			like the Lord, and none righteous like our God. Do not boast or talk so
			very proudly; let no arrogance come from your mouth. For the Lord is a
			God of knowledge; and God prepares his ways.
			\item He grants the prayers of him who prays; and blesses the years of
			the righteous. The Lord will weaken his adversary; the Lord is holy.
			\abr{Glory.}
			\item Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom, nor the powerful boast
			of his power, nor the wealthy boast of his wealth. But let him who
			boasts boast of this; of understanding and knowing the Lord; and of
			executing judgement and righteousness in the midst of the earth.
			\abr{Both now.}
			\item The Lord has gone up to the heavens and thundered; being
			righteous he will judge the ends of the earth.He will give strength

			O Lord, I heard your report and was afraid; Lord I considered your works
			and was amazed. When my soul is troubled, in anger you will remember mercy.
			God will come from Teman; and the Holy One from a shady, wooded mountain.
			His glory covered the heavens; and the earth was full of his praise.

			From nightfall my spirit is awake for you, O God; for your commands are
			light upon the earth. Learn righteousness, inhabitants of the earth.
			Let the impious be taken away, that he may not see the glory of the Lord.
			O Lord your hand was lifted up and they knew it not; but once they know
			they will be ashamed. Jealousy will seize an untaught people; and now
			fire devours their adversaries.
			\item Bring evils upon them, O Lord, bring evils upon them; the glorious
			ones of the earth. O Lord in affliction we remembered you, with a little
			affliction you chastised us.
			\abr{Glory.}
			\item As the woman in labour draws near the time of her delivery and
			cries out in her labour; so have we been to your beloved. We shall not
			fall, but they will fall, the inhabitants of the earth.

			I cried to the Lord; and he heard me. You cast me into the depths of the
			heart of the sea; and the floods surrounded me. All your billows and your
			waves passed over me. Shall I look again towards your holy temple?
			\item Water encompassed me, even to my soul; the lowest deep closed round
			me. My head went down to the clefts of the mountains; I descended into the
			earth, whose bars are eternal barriers.

			my prayer come to you, to your holy temple.
