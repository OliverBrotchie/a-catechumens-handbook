  The Royal Psalms are read before serving a Liturgy; for daily Matins, continue to Section \ref{matins-litany-before-six-psalms}.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\psalm{19}{
  May the Lord hear you in the day of trouble; may the name of the God of Jacob
  shield you. May he send you his help from the holy place, and support 
  you from Sion. May he remember your every sacrifice, and accept with favour
  your whole burnt offering. May the Lord give you your heart's desire, and
  fulfil your every purpose. We shall rejoice in your salvation, and be
  magnified in the name of our the Lord our God. May the Lord fulfil all
  your petitions. Now I know that the Lord has saved his Christ.
  He will hear him from his holy heaven; in mighty acts is the salvation 
  of his right hand. Some put their trust in chariots and some in horses,
  but we will call on the name of the Lord our God. They were fettered 
  and fell, but we have risen and been set upright. Lord, save the king, 
  and hear us on the day we call upon you.
}
\psalm{20}{
  The king will rejoice in your power, O Lord, he will exult exceedingly 
  in your salvation. You gave him his heart's desire; you did not deny
  him the request of his lips. For you came to meet him with blessings
  of goodness; you placed a crown of precious stones upon his head.
  He asked you for life, and you gave him length of days for age on age.
  Great is his glory because of your salvation; you will place on him
  glory and majesty. For you will give him blessing for age on age,
  and make him glad with the joy of your countenance. For the king
  puts his hope in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Most High
  he will not be shaken. May your hand light upon all your enemies,
  and your right hand find out all who hate you. You will make them
  like a blazing oven at the time of your presence. The Lord will
  confound them in his wrath and fire will devour them. You will
  destroy their offspring from the earth, and their seed from among
  the children of mankind. Because they intended evils against you,
  and devised plans by which they can in no way succeed. For you will
  put them to flight; among your remnants you will prepare their
  presence. Be exalted, Lord, in your power; we will sing and praise
  your mighty acts.

\subsection{The Six Psalms}
\label{matins-six-psalms}
\instruction{ 
  And we begin the Six Psalms, listening with complete silence and compunction.
  During the Six Psalms the Priest reads the Twelve Morning Prayers.
  The Superior, or the designated reader, with devotion and fear of God reads.
  \footnote{
    The Six Psalms should be read by one reader, not divided between several. 
    They are one of the gerontika, that is the parts normally read by the Superior,
    and should be allocated to a senior person, such a visiting priest. All should
    remain standing during the Six Psalms.

\psalm{3}{
  Lord, why have those who afflict me been multiplied? Many rise against me.
  Many say to my soul, "There is no salvation for him in his God". But you,
  Lord, are my helper, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. With my
  voice, I cried to the Lord, and he heard me from his holy mountain. I lay
  down and slept; I awoke, because the Lord will assist me. I will not be afraid
  of tens of thousands of people who surround me. Rise, Lord, save me, my
  God; because you have struck all who are vainly my foes. You have smashed
  the teeth of sinners. Salvation is the Lord's, and your blessing is upon your
  people.

}
\psalm{37}{
  Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath. For
  your arrows have been stuck fast in me, and you have laid a heavy hand upon
  me. There is no healing in my flesh on account of your wrath, nor peace in my
  bones on account of my sins. My iniquities flooded over my head; like a heavy
  burden they weighed heavily upon me. My wounds stank and festered on account of
  my foolishness. I was wretched and utterly bowed down; I went about mourning 
  all day long. For my loins were filled with mockings, and there is no healing
  in my flesh. I was maltreated and humiliated exceedingly; I howled from the
  groaning of my heart. Lord, all my desire is before you, and my groaning was
  not hidden from you. My heart was troubled, my strength failed me; and even the
  light of my eyes had gone from me. My friends and my neighbours drew near and
  stood against me, and those nearest me stood far away. Those who sought my life
  used force, and those who sought evils for me spoke vanities, and meditated
  trickeries all day long. But I, like a deaf man, heard nothing; like one who is
  dumb, who does not open his mouth. So I became like one who cannot hear, and in
  whose mouth there are no rebukes. For in you, Lord, I have hoped; you will
  answer me, O Lord my God. For I  said: Let my foes never exult over me.
  When my foot slipped they crowed over me. For I am ready for blows and my pain
  is with me continually. For I will declare my iniquity and be troubled at my sin.
  But my enemies live and have prevailed over me, and those who hate me unjustly
  have been multiplied. Those who repay me with evils in place of good have
  slandered me, since I pursued goodness. Do not forsake me, Lord; my God, do not
  go far from me. Hasten to help me, Lord of my salvation.

\psalm{62}{
  O God, my God, I watch for you at dawn; my soul has thirsted for you, my flesh
  how often in a desert, untrodden and waterless land. Thus I appeared before you
  in the holy place, to see your power and your glory. For your mercy is better than
  life; my lips will praise you. So I will bless you as long as I live, and in your
  name I will lift up my hands. May my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness;
  my mouth will praise you with joyful lips. When I remembered you upon my bed, every
  dawn I meditated upon you. For you became my helper, and in the shelter of your
  wings I shall rejoice. My soul clung to you; and your right hand upheld me.
  But those who vainly sought my life will go down to the deepest parts of the earth,
  they will be delivered to the power of the sword, they will be portions for foxes.
  But the king will rejoice in God, and all who swear by him will be praised; for
  the mouths of those who speak iniquities have been stopped.

\psalm{87}{
  Lord, God of my salvation, I have cried by day, and by night also before you.
  Let my prayer come into your presence, and turn you ear to my supplication.
  For my soul was filled with evils, and my life drew near to Hell. I was reckoned
  among those that go down to the Pit; I became as one that has no help, free among
  the dead. Like the slain that sleep in the tomb, whom you remembered no more; and they
  were cut off from your power. They placed me in the lowest Pit; in darkness and in the
  shadow of death. Your wrath lay heavy upon me, and you brought all your waves against
  me. You put my friends far from me, and made me an abomination to them. I was
  handed over and I came out; my eyes grew weak because of my beggary. I cried to you,
  Lord, all the day; I stretched out my hands towards you. Will you work wonders for
  the dead; or will physicians raise them up again to praise you? Will any declare your
  mercy in the tomb, or your truth in the place of destruction? Will your wonders be
  known in the dark, or your righteousness in a land that has been forgotten? But to you,
  Lord, I have cried, and in the morning my prayer will come before you. Why have you
  rejected my soul, Lord; why do you turn away your face from me? I am poor and in toils
  since my youth; exalted, I was humbled and brought to despair. Your fierce anger
  overwhelmed me, and your terrors appalled me. They surrounded me like water all day
  long; they closed in upon me from every side. Friend and neighbour you have put far
  from me, and my companions because of my misery.

\psalm{102}{
  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
  Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget none of his benefits. He forgives all your
  iniquities; he heals all your diseases; he redeems your life from corruption
  and crowns you with mercy and compassion; he satisfies your desire with
  good things; your youth will be renewed like an eagle's. The Lord performs
  deeds of mercy and judgement for all who are oppressed. He made known his
  ways to Moses, his wishes to the children of Israel. The Lord is compassionate
  and merciful, long-suffering and full of mercy. He will not always be wrathful,
  nor will he be enraged for ever. He has not dealt with us according to our
  iniquities, nor rewarded us according to our sins. For, like the height of
  heaven above the earth, the Lord has made his mercy prevail over those that
  fear him. As far as the east is from the west, so far has he taken our sins from
  us. As a father takes pity on his children the Lord has taken pity on those who
  fear him. For he knows of what we are made; has remembered that we are but dust.
  As for man, his days are but as grass, he will blossom like a flower of the
  field; for when a wind has passed over it, it will be no more and will know its
  place no longer. But the mercy of the Lord is for ever and ever upon those
  who fear him; and his justice upon their children's children, upon those who
  keep his covenant and remember his commandments to do them. The Lord
  has prepared his throne in heaven and his kingdom rules over all. Bless the
  Lord, all you his Angels, powerful in strength, who perform his word, and
  listen to the voice of his words. Bless the Lord, all you his Powers, his
  Ministers who do his will. Bless the Lord, all you his works. In every place
  of his dominion, bless the Lord, O my soul!
  \abr{And again.}
  \item In your justice hear me, O Lord; and do not enter into judgement with
  your servant. \alt{(x2)}
